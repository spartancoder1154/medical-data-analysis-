Here's a README-style summary paragraph for the code in your `medical-data-analysis-` repository:

---

This script performs basic **data wrangling and analysis on a raw string of medical records**. It begins by storing and formatting the data, replacing symbols and removing unnecessary whitespace. The script splits the input into individual records, then extracts and cleans fields such as names, ages, BMI values, and insurance costs. Key operations include converting data types, computing the total number of records, calculating average BMI and insurance costs, and outputting formatted summaries for each individual. This code is a foundational example of transforming unstructured text into analyzable data in Python.
